We had ofended to the king, and he has disolved our government, this is a major setback to the reformist chause.

We will come back

@Negociate
on-arrival: president_council_minister = "Romanones"
subtitle: There's nothing we can do

The king accepts this change, but is a setback on reforms, Romanones is very conservative.
